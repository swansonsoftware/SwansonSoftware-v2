            <h2 className="headline__h2">Background</h2>
          </div>
          <div className="row__colspan-8">
            <p>I have worked in software development for many years, for companies of all sizes, and I have seen the tools and processes evolve. The evolution has been dramatic: the first programming I did was Fortran on punch cards, where program code was written first on graph paper for use when punching the cards; later I programmed on a teletype with a modem connected to a time share computer where the source code was stored, and the executable was punched out on paper tape. The first PCs I programmed on had a monochrome character user interface, and the text editors didn’t have syntax highlighting or contextual help. Later the graphical user interface became ubiquitous, applications became harder to write, and code editors and development environments gradually improved with syntax highlighting, context-sensitive help, and later code hints, and they became more expensive. There were no good alternatives to expensive integrated development environments for some time, but open-source software took off, and now we have Visual Studio Code, a free code editor that supports syntax highlighting, code suggestions and auto completion, context sensitive command help, embedded source control with Git and more. Visual Studio Code is what I use now, and a free Git account to store project files in the cloud on github.</p>

            <h3 className="headline__h3">Historical Perspective</h3>
            <p>Years ago, companies I worked for didn't use applications to track software bugs. Bugs were tracked in a text file or spreadsheet, or not at all. From 1997 through 1999 I worked for an insurance company that didn’t track software bugs; a colleague of mine, a business analyst who doubled as QA engineer, kept a spreadsheet of bugs for his own use. Today we have web-based applications for tracking bugs and for source control, many with free plans.</p>

            <p>We have learned about software life cycles and design patterns, and how to improve programming skills with reviews. Yet, things still go wrong; and when they go right, perhaps no one knows why. Too often projects are not finished on time, or a product release is buggy, or performance is unacceptable. These are the issues SwansonSoftware strives to address, through articles that gather many of the best sources that have stood the test of time, and through anecdotes from experience.</p>
