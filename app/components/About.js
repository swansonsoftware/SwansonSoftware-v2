          </div>
          <div className="row__colspan-8">
            <p>Having worked in software development for over 30 years, for companies of all sizes from 2 developers to hundreds, I have seen the tools and processes evolve. The evolution has been dramatic: the first programming I did was on punch cards; later it was on teletype with a modem connected to a time share computer and programs stored on punched tape; after that it was on a PC with program code stored in a source control systems including SourceSafe and SVN; and now we have web-based source control with github, which SwansonSoftware uses to store its application code.</p>

            <h3 className="headline__h3">Historical Perspective</h3>
            <p>Long ago, source code control was a manual process, there was no application for that. Software editing was done in a character-based terminal connected to a main frame, or the character-based screen of a PC, or on a teletype that used paper feed instead of a display monitor; later, with Mac and Windows PCs, editing was made easier with a text editor. Code editors did not highlight syntax or provide help with spelling like they do today.</p>

            <p>Years ago, we didn't use applications to track software bugs. Bugs were tracked in a text file or spreadsheet, or not at all. From 1997 through 1999 I worked for an insurance company that didnâ€™t track software bugs; a colleague of mine, a business analyst, kept a spreadsheet of bugs for his own use. Today we have web-based applications for tracking bugs and for source control, many with free plans for small teams; we have development environments that not only highlight syntax, but provide suggestions on syntax alternatives, fix mistakes, and much more.</p>

            <p>We also learned about software life cycles and design, and how to improve programming skills with reviews. Yet, things still go wrong; and when they go right, perhaps no one knows why. Too often projects are not finished on time, or a product release is buggy, or performance is unacceptable. These are the issues SwansonSoftware strives to address, through a set of pages that gather together many of the best sources that have stood the test of time, and through anecdotes from experience.</p>
